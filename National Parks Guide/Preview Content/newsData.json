July 22, 2022 – The National Park Service (NPS) is announcing the next steps in advancing recovery efforts to mitigate roadside tree hazards resulting from the KNP Complex Wildfire which burned over 88,000 acres of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (parks) from September through October of 2021. Where moderate to high severity fire crossed roadways, many of the fire-killed trees are now considered tree hazards – meaning they pose a direct risk to human safety and property due to the likelihood of their failure and potential to hit a human or man-made target.",
