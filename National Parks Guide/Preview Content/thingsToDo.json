Rocks, mountains, valleys, and cliffs tell a story, a story of nature and its ability to create and change the natural features we see today.</p> <br /> Consisting of more than 47,000 acres, Acadia National Park preserves more than two dozen glacially sculpted mountains and valleys, glacial lakes and ponds, and one fjard known as Somes Sound.<br /> <br /> Acadia National Park was formed by a series of geological events that began 500 million years ago. As you look around the park you will notice a lot of exposed rocks. All three different types of rocks—metamorphic, sedimentary, and igneous—are found in the park. Rocks have laid the foundation of Acadia National Park and our story here. Their location, formation, and appearance demonstrate the power of glaciers.<br /> <br /> Starting one million years ago, several great ice sheets called continental glaciers covered much of North America, including Maine, for various periods of time. The last glacial period ended 18,000 years ago. Glaciers are formed when more snow falls than melts. As snow accumulates over thousands of years, the weight of the snow compacts and causes lower layers to turn to ice. Frozen ice pack moves in the same fashion as water following the forces of gravity to the lowest point. The rate of travel, however, is much slower. The massive mile-thick glacier that covered this area moved only a few yards each year. This slow glacial movement crafted some of the most impressive natural features you see on Mount Desert Island today.<br /> <br /> Before there was Mount Desert Island, there was the Mount Desert Range. When the last continental glacier reached the Mount Desert Range, the high mountains temporarily obstructed the forward movement of the massive glacier. The high peaks in the northern section acted as a dam, holding back the forward momentum of the glacier until additional ice accumulated and eventually spilled over the mountain peaks. The last glacial event carved the trough known today as Somes Sound, dividing the mountain range in half and giving Mount Desert Island its characteristic horseshoe shape. As the glacier continued to flow 400 miles into the ocean, it carved deep saddles in the mountains, and the erosive power of the glaciers eventually deepened these saddles into valleys. The result of the last glacial event was a reorientation of the mountain range from east-west to north-south.<br /> <br /> Eventually the glacier thickened, and it buried the newly formed Mount Desert Island. The glacier left its mark as it continued to move along. Your journey through Acadia National Park’s EarthCache Program will unravel the story of glacial activity. Each site will demonstrate some aspect of the glacier’s sheer power to transform the landscape.<br /> <br /> Use the clues and information provided to get from one place to another, but remember that although the glaciers have subsided and melted, the story of nature is not over. In fact, it is an everlasting story, and if we aren’t careful, our use of the land can impact nature just as drastically as the glaciers. The plants and their ecosystems that have flourished as result of nature’s story are fragile. Where we step will change the plants and ecosystem of the area, so remember that all sites are on the trail—there is no need to go off trail. Please travel only on trails or on other hardened rock surfaces. <h2>First Clue</h2> <p>To arrive at your first stop, take the road that shares a name with the park’s second highest peak.</p> N 44° 19.110’<br /> W 68°18.364’",

Enjoy a taste of history on this hike with a plaque dedicated to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/waldron-bates-pathmaker.htm\">Waldron Bates</a>. Bates was a visionary when it came to outdoor recreation and many trails in the park exist because of his dedication. </p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Distance: 3.5 mile round trip. Choosing to do the Cadillac Cliff trail section does not change the distance only changes the difficulty. </li> <li>Terrain and Safety: The trail is rocky with uneven footing. Good foot wear is recommended. The Cadillac Cliff trail section does involve rungs and ladders. Caution is advised during inclement weather.</li> </ul> <h2>Hike Description</h2> <ul> <li>The hike begins at the southwest corner of the Gorham Mountain parking lot. Look for a large stump with Gorham Mountain trail carved into it. </li> <li>Follow the trail gradually up granite slab 0.2 miles until the trail intersects with Cadillac Cliff Trail. This is also where the Bates plaque resides. Continue left to remain on the Gorham Mountain loop hike. <ul> <li>To the right is the Cadillac Cliff trail. This 0.3 mile section goes along old sea cliffs. The trail does have rungs and ladders to assist hikers over rock scrambles. It finishes with a steep granite stair climb where it returns back to the Gorhman Mountain loop.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The trail begins to involve rocky uneven surfaces and it continues 0.3 miles until it meet up with the Cadillac Cliff trail again.</li> <li>From this intersection the trail continues another 0.4 mile to the summit of Gorham Mountain. Be aware that a couple hundred feet from the summit is a false summit. Beautiful views but to continue the loop keep following the trail until you reach the summit marker. </li> <li>Past the summit the trail descends down rocky terrain 0.5 miles until it reaches the Bowl trail. Head right on the bowl trail 0.5 miles where it will come out at the entrance to Sand Beach.</li> <li>Cross the crosswalk safely and walk to the end of the upper Sand Beach parking lot. Here the Ocean Path trail will follow the coastline 0.7 miles to Thunder Hole.</li> <li>Keep on the Ocean Path trail after Thunder Hole for another 0.3 miles. Be looking for a stump with Gorham Mountain carved into it. Cross the crosswalk safely to the Gorham Mountain parking lot to finish the hike.</li> </ul>",

Steep drop offs with no railings require secure footings. Good foot wear is recommended.This trail is very dangerous in inclement weather. During rain events granite becomes extremely slippery. Allowing the rocks to dry provides a safer ascent. </p> </li> </ul>",

Butterflies are common here, as are pitch pine, cedar, birch, and ash trees. This pleasant trail highlights the contrast between ocean and old farmland.</li> <li><strong>Anvil Trail:</strong> This trail provides access to incredible views from both the rocky knob known as the Anvil and the 440-foot Schoodic Head. The trail starts by climbing through woods of ash, birch, and spruce and ends atop rocky summits.</li> <li><strong>Buck Cove Mountain Trail: </strong>This is the network's longest trail at just over 3 miles. The trail skirts the edge of Birch Harbor Mountain and leads to Schoodic Head summit. While it is longer and has more climbing than some of the network's other trails, the elevation gains allow for incredible views of the surrounding area and make this a very worth-while hike.</li> <li><strong>East Trail:</strong> This short but steep trail goes up the eastern side of Schoodic Head, with views along the way of Schoodic Point to the southwest and Spruce Point to the northeast. The trail begins with a steady ascent, then rises quickly via switchbacks. In the spring, Canada dogwood and tiny white starflowers bloom along the trail. Gnarled pitch pines, cedars, and sea-green lichen are plentiful here.</li> <li><strong>Lower Harbor Trail: </strong>This trail offers waterfront views for the majority of its 1.2 mile stretch. The flat terrain and coastal views make this a trail perfect for everyone to enjoy.</li> <li><strong>Schoodic Head:</strong> This trail provides a fresh perspective on Acadia National Park and expansive views of the area.

The 8,000-acre island—3,200 acres of which are part of Acadia—is just off the shores of Stonington, Maine. Although the island has a low variety of breeding songbirds because of its mono-landscape dominated by Red Spruce and Balsam Fir, it is ideally located as a migratory stopover for a variety of warblers, shorebirds, and terns. This means the best time to visit the island is May or August. Lastly, the island is accessible only by ferry, this allows the ideal opportunity to scan the waters for Northern Gannet, Black Guillemot, Common Eider among other sea ducks and pelagic birds.",
